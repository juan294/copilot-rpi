# Release New Version

Prepare and publish a new version release, adapted to the project type.

## Step 1: Orientation

Gather release context before making any changes.

1. **Detect project type** from manifest files:

   | Check | Type | Version source | Publish action |
   |-------|------|---------------|----------------|
   | `package.json` | Node/npm | `version` field | Advisory: "Ready for `npm publish`" |
   | `Cargo.toml` | Rust | `version` field | Advisory: "Ready for `cargo publish`" |
   | `pyproject.toml` | Python | `version` field | Advisory: "Ready for `twine upload`" |
   | `go.mod` | Go | Git tags only | Advisory: "Tag pushed, `go get` ready" |
   | None of above | Docs/generic | CHANGELOG.md or git tags | No publish step |

2. **Find current version** from the manifest file or latest git tag.

3. **Find last release tag** and compute changes since then:
   `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline`

4. **Identify all version-bearing files** -- do NOT rely on memory or a static
   list. Grep the CURRENT version string across the whole repo so nothing is
   missed:

   ```bash
   git grep -n -F "1.2.3"; git grep -n -F "v1.2.3"   # both bare and v-prefixed
   ```

   Hand-maintained version strings drift silently when there is no canonical
   manifest. Explicitly confirm these commonly-missed locations, even if a
   scoped scan would skip them:

   - **README/docs shield.io badges** -- the version can appear 3x on ONE line
     (badge label text, the `img.shields.io` URL, and the `releases/tag/` link href).
   - **Marketplace or extension manifests** that carry their own `"version"`.
   - manifests, install instructions, constants files, docker tags, CI configs,
     documentation site configs, compatibility tables.

   For docs/generic repos with no manifest, git tag + CHANGELOG are the source
   of truth and every other version string is hand-maintained -- the grep is
   mandatory, not optional.

5. **Detect branching strategy:**
   - Check if current branch is main/master
   - Check for a permanent integration branch:
     `git branch -a --list '*develop' '*dev' '*integration'`
   - Check git log for merge commits from feature/release branches
   - If a long-lived `develop` (or `dev`/`integration`) branch exists and releases
     go `develop` -> `main`: **develop-based**
   - Else if on main AND no merge-branch pattern: **main-only**
   - Otherwise: **feature-branch**

6. **Present findings** to the user:
   - Project type and version source
   - Current version
   - Commits since last release, categorized by type
   - All version-bearing files found
   - Detected branching strategy
   - Suggest major/minor/patch bump based on commit types

7. **Retirement review.** Ask what rules, errors, or instructions came OUT of
   the project's guidance corpus this cycle, not just what went in. If the
   project keeps a retirement ledger, confirm it records them. Answer the
   question every release, even when the answer is "none" -- a corpus with an
   intake path and no exit path only grows.

8. **Consider related commands:**
   - If there are unreleased changes, remind the user to consider
     running `/update-docs` first to refresh all documentation.
   - If this is the first release, recommend running `/pre-launch`.
   - Run `/status` for a quick orientation if the project state is unclear.

**STOP.** Ask the user for the version number before proceeding.

## Step 2: Preparation

After the user provides a version number, prepare all files. Do not publish.

1. **Bump version in manifest files** (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.).
   If a lock file tracks the version (package-lock.json), update it too.

2. **Generate CHANGELOG entry** from commits since last tag. Categorize
   by conventional commit prefix into Keep a Changelog format:

   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added
   - feat: commits summarized here

   ### Fixed
   - fix: commits summarized here

   ### Changed
   - refactor/chore commits summarized here
   ```

   Present the draft to the user for review. Apply edits before writing.

3. **Update version references** in all files identified in Step 1:
   README badges (all occurrences on the line), marketplace/extension
   manifests, install instructions, constants, docker tags, etc. Then re-run
   the grep from Step 1 for the OLD version and confirm nothing remains
   outside CHANGELOG history -- a non-empty result (other than dated CHANGELOG
   entries) means a file was missed.

4. **Run verification commands** via terminal (chain sequentially):
   typecheck, lint, test, build. For blueprint/docs repos this includes the
   repo-invariant scripts (`verify-counts.sh`, `verify-version.sh`,
   `verify-prompts.sh`).
   If any fail, fix before proceeding.

5. **Present the full diff** to the user.

**STOP.** Wait for the user to review and approve before publishing.

## Step 3: Publish

After human approval, execute the release. The flow depends on the
branching strategy detected in Step 1.

### Main-only flow

Confirm with the user before creating the tag and GitHub release.
Present what will be tagged and published, then proceed after approval.

1. Create the release commit:
   `git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z -- [summary from CHANGELOG]"`

2. Create an annotated git tag:
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`

3. Push the commit, then the tag by name:
   `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`

4. Create the GitHub release:
   `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "[CHANGELOG entry]"`

5. Verify CI:
   `gh run list --branch main --limit 1`

6. Report the result with a link to the GitHub release.
   If the project has a registry publish step, remind the user:
   "Release is published. When ready, run `npm publish` / etc."

### Feature-branch flow

1. Create a release branch and commit:
   `git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`

2. Push the branch:
   `git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z`

3. Check for an existing PR before creating one:
   `gh pr list --head release/vX.Y.Z`
   If no existing PR, create one (Error #29).

4. Verify CI on the PR.

5. **STOP.** Tell the user to review and merge the PR. After merge,
   provide the commands to tag and release:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "[CHANGELOG entry]"
   ```

6. Report the result with a link to the PR.

### Develop-based flow

Use when `develop` (or `dev`/`integration`) is the **permanent** integration branch and the
release is a PR from `develop` -> `main` directly. There is NO intermediate `release/vX.Y.Z`
branch -- the integration branch already holds the changes.

1. Land the release prep on the integration branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop && git pull --rebase
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z -- [summary from CHANGELOG]"
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. Check for an existing release PR before creating one:

   ```bash
   gh pr list --base main --head develop
   ```

   If none, open the `develop` -> `main` PR:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "release: vX.Y.Z" --body "[CHANGELOG entry]"
   ```

3. Verify CI on the PR:

   ```bash
   gh run list --branch develop --limit 1
   ```

4. Merge with squash + auto-merge. NEVER pass `--delete-branch` -- `develop` is permanent
   (Rule #53):

   ```bash
   gh pr merge --squash --auto
   ```

   Repos standardized per Rule #53 enable delete-branch-on-merge, but that only removes
   ordinary feature heads; deleting the permanent integration branch would be destructive.

5. **STOP.** Wait for the PR to merge (confirm with `gh pr view --json state`). After it lands,
   tag the squashed release commit on `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --rebase
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes "[CHANGELOG entry]"
   ```

6. Report the result with a link to the PR and the GitHub release.
   If the project has a registry publish step, remind the user:
   "After tagging, run `npm publish` / `cargo publish` / etc."

## Rules

- NEVER use `git push --tags` -- push tags by name (Error #20).
- NEVER use `--body` with `gh release create` -- use `--notes`.
- ALWAYS check for an existing PR before creating one (Error #29).
- ALWAYS verify CI after push.
- ALWAYS present the diff before committing (Step 2 gate).
- ALWAYS ask for the version number -- never guess or auto-increment.
- Registry publish (npm/cargo/twine) is ADVISORY ONLY -- tell the user
  it is ready, do not run it. Most registries require 2FA and publishing
  cannot be undone.
- Run verification commands sequentially, not in parallel.
