# Copilot-Specific Instructions

<!-- This file supplements AGENTS.md with Copilot-specific guidance.
     Most instructions belong in AGENTS.md (cross-tool) or path-specific instructions.
     Only put things here that are unique to GitHub Copilot behavior. -->

## Chat Modes

This project includes specialized chat modes in `.github/chatmodes/`:
- **RPI Research** — Documentarian-constrained research mode (read-only)
- **RPI Planner** — Interactive planning mode with pseudocode output
- **RPI Auditor** — Read-only validation with structured reports

Use the appropriate chat mode when starting an RPI phase for better behavioral constraints.

## Prompt Files

RPI workflow prompts are in `.github/prompts/`:
- `/research` — Codebase exploration
- `/plan` — Implementation planning
- `/implement` — Phase-by-phase execution
- `/validate` — Post-implementation verification
- `/describe-pr` — PR description generation
- `/pre-launch` — Production audit

## Context References

When working in Copilot Chat:
- Use `#codebase` for broad repository searches
- Use `#file:path/to/file.ts` to add specific files to context
- Use `#tool:terminal` to run shell commands in agent mode
- Use `#selection` to reference currently selected code

## Auto-Compaction

Copilot auto-compacts context at ~95% usage. For better results:
- Proactively write a handoff document at ~60% usage
- Start a new Chat window pointing at the handoff doc
- This produces significantly better output than relying on auto-compaction
