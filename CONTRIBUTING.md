### What We're Looking For

- **New error patterns** — If you've encountered a recurring agent mistake not in `patterns/agent-errors.md`, document it with the symptom, root cause, correct approach, and what to avoid.
- **Methodology improvements** — Refinements to the RPI workflow based on real-world usage.
- **Template enhancements** — Better defaults, missing configuration surfaces, or improved prompt files.
- **Documentation fixes** — Typos, unclear wording, broken links.

### Writing Guidelines

- Keep entries generic — no project-specific references.
- Follow the existing format and structure of each file.
- Use plain, direct language. Avoid filler words.
- When adding error patterns, include a one-liner in `patterns/quick-reference.md` alongside the detailed entry in `patterns/agent-errors.md`.

### Markdown Style

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- One sentence per line where practical (aids diffs).
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers.
- Keep lines under 120 characters where possible.
