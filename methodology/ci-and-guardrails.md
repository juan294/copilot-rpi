# CI & Development Guardrails

Guardrails are automated enforcement layers that catch mistakes before they reach the repository. They work at three levels: editor-time, commit-time, and push-time.

## The Enforcement Stack

```text
Level 1: Editor-time (VS Code settings + extensions)
├── Formatter runs on save (Prettier, Black, rustfmt)
├── Linter runs on save (ESLint, Ruff, clippy)
└── Agent sees errors immediately and fixes them

Level 2: Commit-time (pre-commit hooks)
├── Typecheck across the project
├── Lint across the project
├── Tests (unit, optionally integration)
└── Commit is rejected if any check fails

Level 3: Push-time (CI workflows)
├── Full test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
├── Type checking
├── Lint
├── Build verification
├── Security audit (dependency vulnerabilities)
└── Push accountability agent monitors results
```

Each level catches progressively harder-to-detect issues. The goal: **no broken code ever reaches the shared branch.**

## Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are the first line of defense. They run automatically before every commit and reject the commit if any check fails.

### Setup

Use a framework like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) (Node.js), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (Python), or native git hooks:

```bash
# Example: Husky (Node.js projects)
npx husky init
echo "pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint" > .husky/pre-commit
```

### What to Run in Pre-Commit

| Check | Why | Speed |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Typecheck** | Catches type errors before they hit CI | Medium |
| **Lint** | Catches style violations and common bugs | Fast |
| **Unit tests** | Catches regressions immediately | Fast-Medium |
| **Format check** | Ensures consistent formatting | Fast |

**Don't include in pre-commit:** E2E tests (too slow), full builds (too slow), dependency audits (too slow for every commit). Save these for CI.

### Agent Interaction

Agents must run the same checks pre-commit hooks run **before** attempting to commit (see [quick-reference.md rule #5](../patterns/quick-reference.md)). This avoids the wasted cycle of: commit → hook fails → fix → re-commit.

```bash
# Agent workflow before committing:
pnpm run typecheck 2>&1; pnpm run lint 2>&1  # Run checks first
# Fix any errors
git add <files> && git commit -m "..."         # Then commit (hook will pass)
```

## CI Workflows

CI workflows run on every push and PR. They are the authoritative verification — if CI is green, the code is shippable.

### Recommended CI Pipeline

```yaml
# Conceptual workflow (adapt to your CI system):
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    steps:
      - Install dependencies
      - Run typecheck
      - Run lint
      - Run unit tests
      - Run integration tests

  build:
    steps:
      - Install dependencies
      - Build the project
      - Check bundle sizes (optional threshold)

  security:
    steps:
      - Run dependency audit
      - Check for hardcoded secrets (optional)

  e2e:
    needs: build
    steps:
      - Run E2E tests against the built artifact
```

### CI Design Principles

1. **Fast feedback.** Parallelize independent jobs. Typecheck, lint, and tests can run simultaneously.
2. **Fail fast.** Put the quickest checks first. A lint error found in 10 seconds is better than waiting 5 minutes for the build to fail.
3. **Required checks.** Mark critical jobs as required for PR merges. Don't let broken code merge.
4. **Artifact caching.** Cache `node_modules`, build outputs, and test fixtures across runs to speed up CI.
5. **Branch protection.** Require CI to pass before merging PRs. Require at least one review approval.

## Development Guardrails

Beyond automated checks, guardrails include process rules that prevent common mistakes:

### Branch Protection

- **Production branch** (`main`/`master`) — Protected. No direct pushes. PRs only, with required CI and review.
- **Development branch** (`develop`) — Semi-protected. Agents can push directly, but push accountability monitors CI.
- **Feature branches** — Unprotected. Agents create, push, and clean up freely.

### Environment Safety

- **Secrets in `.env`** — Never committed. Gitignored.
- **No secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`** (or equivalent) — Client-visible env vars must never contain secrets.
- **Documented required variables** — AGENTS.md lists every required env var so agents know what's available.

### Dependency Safety

- **Lock files committed** — `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, etc. must be in version control.
- **Regular audits** — `pnpm audit` / `npm audit` in CI catches known vulnerabilities.
- **License compliance** — No copyleft dependencies in proprietary projects.

## Guardrails and Agent Autonomy

Guardrails are what make agent autonomy safe. When pre-commit hooks catch errors, CI verifies builds, and branch protection prevents unauthorized merges, agents can operate with high autonomy on the development branch without risk of damage.

The relationship is:

- **More guardrails** → more agent autonomy is safe
- **Fewer guardrails** → more human oversight is needed

Invest in guardrails early. They pay for themselves by enabling faster, more autonomous agent workflows.
