# Testing Philosophy

## The Hierarchy

```text
Automated (ALWAYS preferred)
├── Test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
├── Build commands
├── Type checking / linting
├── API response verification (curl, http tools)
├── File/output inspection
└── Code pattern verification (grep)

Manual (ONLY when automation is impossible)
├── Requires sudo/elevated privileges
├── Requires installing new software
├── Requires physical hardware interaction
└── Requires browser visual validation that truly can't be captured programmatically
```

## Success Criteria Format

Always separate into two sections:

```markdown
### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Type check passes: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Lint passes: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] API responds correctly: `curl localhost:3000/api/endpoint`

#### Manual Verification (only if truly impossible to automate)
- [ ] [Step] — WHY manual: [requires sudo / hardware / visual-only]
```

## TDD Protocol

Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all code changes. No exceptions — not even "small" changes.

### The Cycle

1. **Red** — Write a failing test FIRST, before touching any implementation code
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** — Clean up while keeping tests green

### Rules

- **Tests before code, always.** If you catch yourself writing implementation without a test, stop and write the test first.
- **Bug fixes need a regression test.** Before fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces it. Then fix the code so the test passes. This ensures the bug never returns.
- **Refactors need existing tests.** Before refactoring, ensure tests cover the current behavior. If they don't, write them first.
- **No "I'll add tests later."** There is no later. Tests are written in the same worktree, in the same commit sequence, before the implementation.
- **Tests are the spec.** A failing test IS the specification for what the code should do. Write the test as if the feature already works, then make it true.

### In the RPI Workflow

TDD integrates into the Implement phase:

1. Plan specifies what each phase should accomplish
2. For each phase, write failing tests that capture the acceptance criteria
3. Implement until all tests pass
4. Run the full verification suite
5. Stop and wait for human review

The tests written in step 2 become the automated verification for the phase.

## Phase Completion Protocol

1. Run ALL automated verification commands.
2. Use tools to inspect outputs, API responses, file changes.
3. If all automated checks pass, mark phase complete.
4. **STOP. Wait for human confirmation.** Even if everything passes.
