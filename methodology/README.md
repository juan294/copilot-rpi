# RPI Methodology for GitHub Copilot

> Adapted from HumanLayer's opencode-rpi implementation and their ACE-FCA (Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents) framework.

## The One-Paragraph Summary

Every significant change goes through four phases: **Research** (understand the codebase as-is), **Plan** (create a phased implementation spec), **Implement** (execute one phase at a time with review gates), **Validate** (verify implementation against the plan). Each phase runs in its own conversation to manage context. Errors amplify downstream — a bad line of research becomes thousands of bad lines of code — so human review is focused on research and plans, not generated code.
