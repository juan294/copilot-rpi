## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/quality-review` prompt** — reviews changed files for code reuse, code quality, and efficiency. Copilot-native equivalent of the quality review concept, scoped to git diff. Interactive (presents findings before fixing), not automatic.
- **Two-pass review model** — implementation phases now separate plan-compliance self-review from code-quality review (`/quality-review`). Documented in `/implement`, `AGENTS.md.template`, and `agent-design.md`.
- **Batch eligibility assessment** — plans now evaluate phase independence and mark `[batch-eligible]` where applicable. Users can parallelize via `copilot -p` fan-out or `@copilot` cloud agent issues.
- **Post-audit quality action** — `/pre-launch` now recommends `/quality-review` as the first fix action for code quality findings.
- **Post-adoption baseline audit** — `/adopt` now recommends running `/pre-launch` after setup for a full codebase quality baseline.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- `/update` now adds new blueprint sections instead of skipping them — projects stay current with new knowledge
- Nightly agent shell script uses `CLAUDE_BIN` env var instead of bare command, fixing `launchd`/`cron` PATH failures
