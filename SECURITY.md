# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains documentation, templates, and methodology guides. It does not contain executable application code. However, the templates and configuration files it provides are used to set up real projects, so accuracy and safety matter.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue — such as a template that introduces an insecure default, a configuration that exposes sensitive data, or advice that could lead to a security problem — please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, email the maintainer directly using the contact information in the repository profile, or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature.

Include:

- A description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or the specific file/line affected.
- Any suggested fix, if you have one.

## Response

- You will receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours.
- A fix or mitigation will be prioritized based on severity.
- Credit will be given in the changelog unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on the `main` branch is actively maintained.
