# Adopt RPI into an Existing Project

Audit what exists, preserve what works, and migrate only the authorized scope.
The request may authorize a complete adoption; do not add repeated approval gates
for routine safe items already within that scope.

Read [the lifecycle contract](references/lifecycle-contract.md) completely.
Resolve the installed package/source and target project from actual metadata and
the request; do not assume the current directory is the intended target. Use the
ownership-aware engine's explicit source/target plan/apply interface. Skill
invocation or tool visibility does not grant extra authority.

## Audit before mutation

Read the current instruction chain, settings, skill/command/rule registrations,
legacy sync metadata, and any ownership manifest/baselines. Identify:

- Configuration: AGENTS/CLAUDE relationship, native and legacy entry points,
  custom commands/skills/hooks, permissions, environment and local extensions.
- Infrastructure: stack, package manager, tests/coverage, lint/build, CI triggers,
  git topology, deployment targets, README and agent-facing surfaces.
- Workflow knowledge: curated research, plans, decisions, handoffs, reports,
  logging and any existing schedule. A missing optional feature is not a defect.

Use bounded independent read-only assignments when useful. Cover all relevant
areas and synthesize after assigned work completes. Read source intelligence,
manifest/templates and relevant domain rules from the resolved local package.
Do not infer ownership from a matching path, title or familiar section header.

## Migration plan

Save a concrete adoption plan in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-rpi-adoption.md` with:

1. Already aligned content to preserve.
2. Required gaps and optional choices, prioritized by impact.
3. Adaptation conflicts: custom instructions, merge/deployment semantics, rules,
   settings, hooks and legacy command names.
4. Harness/route/domain selection and native invocation names.
5. File/block/key ownership, recovery location, verification and completion gates.

Shared intelligence lives in AGENTS.md. CLAUDE.md imports it and keeps Claude-only
additions; do not point Codex back through CLAUDE. Select universal RPI/budget
constraints plus relevant domain skills and conditional rules. Map paths from the
actual repository. Preserve the user-owned Drawio or other local extensions.

## Execute authorized adoption

1. Generate and review an explicit engine `install` plan for source and target.
   Existing v1 metadata is evidence, not permission to overwrite unknown custom
   files. Missing baseline bytes produce retained/conflicted candidates.
2. Apply proven safe changes transactionally. Keep user settings and custom
   content, preserve recovery bytes, and stop only dependent work at a real
   conflict or new decision. Do not replace entire AGENTS/CLAUDE files.
3. Install full selected native skill directories and resources without duplicate
   user/project or plugin/direct registrations. Never merge or edit a plugin cache.
4. Migrate only proven managed v1 command copies. Retire colliding `plan` and
   `status` registrations with recovery and a rename notice. Other legacy aliases
   may be explicit-only rename notices during 2.x; unknown custom aliases remain
   untouched and diagnosed. Do not claim native forwarding unless proven.
5. Migrate owned inline rule blocks only when their complete behavior survives in
   shared instructions or relevant scoped rules. Preserve custom policy and avoid
   a CLAUDE/AGENTS import cycle.
6. Preserve curated research/plans/decisions/handoffs. Apply visibility policy to
   raw reports/logs; never stage entire ignored directories.
7. Adapt [the release playbook](references/e2e-pro-playbook.md): Wave A always;
   structural Waves C-H by actual risk with N/A reasons. Wave B exercises an
   existing authorized immutable candidate through `rpi-explore-release`.
8. Run engine diagnostics and complete applicable local gates. Verify actual
   native entries/resources, rule reachability, settings preservation and recovery.

## Completion

Save the adoption result and durable handoff: what existed, what migrated,
customizations preserved, conflicts, skipped optional features, component/route
selection, actual invocation names, verification and next actions. Update available
project/session memory with nonsecret facts. Commit reviewed local changes
atomically where appropriate; do not publish working branches or trigger remote
compute. An optional `rpi-pre-launch` audit is a later workflow unless authorized.
