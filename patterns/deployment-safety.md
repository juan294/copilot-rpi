# Deployment Safety & Resource Efficiency

Every CI run costs money. Every deployment costs money. Every GitHub Actions minute is billed. Every cloud build minute is billed. Agents must treat these resources with the same care they would treat production data — deliberately, efficiently, and with justification for every action.

This document codifies the lessons from a real production incident where an agent merged 7 Dependabot PRs directly to `main`, triggered 80+ CI runs and 21 production deployments, and took down a live production site for 2+ hours. The total waste: ~60 unnecessary CI runs, ~15 unnecessary deployments, and hours of owner time on manual recovery.

**Every rule in this document exists because an agent violated it and caused real damage.**

## Core Principle: Understand the Deployment Topology

Before touching any branch, the agent must understand what happens when code lands on that branch:

- **Which branches trigger deployments?** (`main` almost always deploys to production)
- **Which branches trigger CI?** (most branches trigger CI on push)
- **What platform hosts the deployments?** (Vercel, AWS, Netlify, Railway, Fly.io, etc.)
- **Is there a staging/preview environment?** (preview URLs, staging servers, dev clusters)
- **What does the CI matrix look like?** (how many workflows run per push?)

If the agent doesn't know the answers, it must check before merging, pushing, or triggering any pipeline.

## Rule: Merging to `main` IS Deploying to Production

In any project with CI/CD connected to `main`, a merge to `main` is a production deployment. There is no distinction between "merging a PR" and "deploying to production." They are the same action.

This means:

- **Dependabot PRs target `main` by default.** Merging them deploys to production immediately.
- **"Clean up the PRs" means close or retarget them** — not merge them to production.
- **The correct workflow for Dependabot:** cherry-pick updates to `develop`, close the Dependabot PR, release via the normal `develop` -> `main` process.
- **"Merge the PRs" is never authorization to deploy to production** unless the user explicitly says "deploy to production" or "merge to main."

---

## Rule: Every Action Has a Cost — Justify It First

Before triggering any CI run, deployment, or external API call, answer three questions:

1. **Is this needed?** Can I achieve the same result locally or with fewer runs?
2. **Is this justified?** Does this directly advance the task, or am I guessing?
3. **Is this verifiable?** Will I know if it succeeded or failed, and what to do next?

If the answer to any of these is "no," do not proceed.

### Cost Awareness Checklist

Before starting any task that involves CI or deployments:

- [ ] How many CI runs will this trigger? If more than 2-3, find a more efficient approach.
- [ ] How many deployments will this trigger? If more than 1-2, find a more efficient approach.
- [ ] Can I batch these changes into a single PR instead of multiple?
- [ ] Can I test this locally before pushing?
- [ ] Am I about to push partial or experimental work to a branch that triggers CI?

## Dependency Updates: Batch, Assess Risk, Verify

### Never Merge Dependencies One-by-One

Merging N dependency PRs sequentially on a branch with "require branches to be up-to-date" protection creates an O(n^2) rebase cascade:

- Merge 1 -> rebase remaining N-1 PRs -> each reruns CI
- Merge 2 -> rebase remaining N-2 PRs -> each reruns CI
- Total wasted CI runs: N x (N-1) / 2 x workflows_per_push

For 7 PRs with 9 workflows each, that's ~189 unnecessary workflow runs.

**The correct approach:**

1. Create a single branch (e.g., `chore/dependency-updates`)
2. Cherry-pick or apply all dependency updates to that branch
3. Run CI once on the combined result
4. Merge the single PR

### Assess Risk Before Merging

Not all dependency updates are equal:

| Risk Level | Examples | Verification Required |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Low** | Dev dependency patches (eslint, prettier) | CI passing is sufficient |
| **Medium** | Runtime library patches/minors (lodash, axios) | CI + local smoke test |
| **High** | Framework upgrades (Next.js, React, Django, Rails) | CI + staging/preview deployment + manual verification |
| **Critical** | Major version bumps of core frameworks | Full QA cycle, staged rollout |

**Framework upgrades must never be merged without testing on the actual deployment platform.** CI passing is necessary but NOT sufficient. Build success does not equal runtime success. Local success does not equal production success.

### Platform Verification Before Production

For any project with a deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, Netlify, Railway, etc.):

1. Deploy the dependency update to a staging or preview environment
2. Verify the deployment: site loads, API routes respond, health checks pass, serverless functions run
3. Only after staging verification succeeds, merge to `main`

Platform-specific bugs (serverless runtime issues, missing modules in bundled functions, container startup failures) will not be caught by local testing or CI. The staging deployment is the only safety net.

## Production Incident Recovery Protocol

When production is down, follow this exact sequence. Do not improvise.

### Step 1: Roll Back Immediately

Roll back to the last known good deployment. Do not investigate first. Do not "try one more thing." The priority is restoring service.

```bash
# Platform-specific rollback examples:

# Vercel:
vercel rollback  # or promote a specific deployment ID from the dashboard

# AWS (ECS/EKS):
aws ecs update-service --cluster X --service Y --task-definition previous-version

# AWS (Lambda):
aws lambda update-alias --function-name X --name prod --function-version previous

# Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod --dir=previous-build  # or use dashboard to publish previous deploy

# Railway/Fly.io/Render:
# Use their dashboard or CLI to redeploy from the previous known-good version

# Git-based rollback (works for all platforms that deploy from main):
git revert HEAD && git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Investigate on Non-Production

Once production is stable on the rollback:

- Read deployment platform logs (function logs, container logs, build logs)
- Deploy the broken code to a staging/preview environment for isolated reproduction
- Test locally (but remember: local != production)

**Never promote a broken deployment "briefly" to capture logs.** Platform logs persist after rollback — you don't need to break production to read them.

### Step 3: Fix Forward on `develop`

1. Create the fix on `develop` (or a feature branch)
2. Test locally
3. Deploy to a staging/preview environment and verify
4. Only after staging verification, create a PR to `main`
5. Merge and verify the production deployment

### Step 4: Count the Cost

Every recovery attempt that fails is another billed deployment and another outage window. Before each recovery action, ask: "Am I confident this will work, or am I guessing?" If guessing, stop and think more.

## Resource Efficiency Patterns

### Local First

Always prefer local operations over remote ones:

- Run tests locally before pushing
- Build locally before deploying
- Verify changes locally before creating PRs
- Use `npm run build` / `pnpm build` / `cargo build` locally before trusting CI

### Minimize Push Events

Each push event can trigger N workflows. Minimize pushes:

- Squash fixes locally before pushing (avoid push-fix-push-fix cycles)
- Use `--amend` and `--force-push` on feature branches (not main) to avoid extra CI runs
- Batch multiple changes into single commits when they're related

### Minimize Deployment Events

- Never push to `main` or production branches for testing
- Use staging/preview environments for verification
- Don't deploy to diagnose — use logs, local reproduction, or isolated environments
- Count deployments before starting: "This task should take 1 deployment. If I'm at 3, something is wrong."

### Parallel Agents: Commit Locally, Push Centrally

When using parallel agents:

- Agents commit locally only — never push or create PRs
- Lead agent reviews all work after completion
- Lead agent batch-pushes all branches in one command
- One agent monitors all CI runs
- See Error #27 for the full pattern

## Anti-Patterns (Real Incidents)

### The Rebase Cascade

Agent merges 7 Dependabot PRs one-by-one. Each merge invalidates checks on remaining PRs. Each remaining PR needs a rebase + full CI re-run. Result: 80+ CI runs, 30 of which were pure waste from rebases.

**Fix:** Batch all updates into a single branch and PR.

### The Accidental Production Deploy

Agent told to "clean up Dependabot PRs." Interprets this as "merge them." Dependabot PRs target `main`. Each merge triggers a production deployment. One dependency has a production-only bug. Site goes down.

**Fix:** Understand that merging to `main` = deploying to production. Cherry-pick updates to `develop` instead.

### The Panic Recovery

Production is down. Agent promotes the broken deployment "briefly" to capture logs — site goes down again. Deploys maintenance mode with errors — fails. Deploys again with env var issues — fails. Each failed attempt is another billed deployment and another outage window.

**Fix:** Roll back immediately. Investigate on non-production. Fix forward on `develop`. Never improvise recovery.

### The Untested Framework Upgrade

Agent merges a framework minor version bump after CI passes. Build succeeds, tests pass, local server works. But on the deployment platform's runtime, a module is missing from the bundle. Every function crashes at startup. The bug only manifests on the deployment platform.

**Fix:** Framework upgrades require staging/preview deployment verification. CI passing != production working.

| Main = production | Merging to `main` is always a production deployment |
| Justify actions | Every CI run and deployment must be needed, justified, and verifiable |
| Batch dependencies | Never merge dependency PRs one-by-one — batch into a single PR |
| Assess risk | Framework upgrades need staging verification; dev patches need CI only |
| Stage before prod | Deploy to staging/preview and verify before merging to `main` |
| Roll back first | When production is down, restore service before investigating |
| Fix forward | Create fixes on `develop`, verify on staging, then release to `main` |
| Count the cost | Track CI runs and deployments — stop if exceeding estimates |
| Local first | Test locally before pushing; build locally before deploying |
